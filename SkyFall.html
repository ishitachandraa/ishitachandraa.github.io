            SkyFall offers a refreshingly unique and interactive approach to phone unlocking, using intuitive yet challenging gameplay mechanics powered by accelerometer, touch, and secret logic. Imagine a serene, minimalist sky where the goal seems simple: guide a small, floating ball into a basketball hoop. However, nothing is as straightforward as it appears.
            <br><br> Upon each attempt to score, SkyFall closes back, subtly encouraging the user to think beyond conventional methods. At its heart, the game relies on the phone’s accelerometer to introduce new layers of engagement and security: tilting the device influences the ball’s movement, enabling players to explore the expansive sky from every angle.
            <br><br> Adding to the intrigue, clouds subtly change the ball’s color, adding another layer of depth to the experience. The pathway to unlocking requires thinking outside the box and a willingness to experiment with unexpected strategies, seamlessly combining elements of spatial reasoning and a cleverly concealed unlock logic.

        <h2>Concept Sketches</h2>
        
            <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;"> 
                In the early stages of concept development, our group initially felt a bit uninspired, as it seemed like all the "cool" and practical phone unlock methods had already been done. We fixated towards color codes and using external materials, like phone charms to aid the unlock.
                <br><br>
                The sketches below showcase various types of phone charms that the user would capture with their camera to unlock the phone in unique ways. For example, the first charm has multiple colors, which the user would scan in a specific secret sequence to fill the screen. The second charm features numerous tiny illustrations, but only one holds the hidden drawing that triggers the unlock. The third charm appears as an inconspicuous group photo, where capturing the face of a particular person initiates the unlock.

                <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;"> 
                It wasn't until Jane's tutorial showcasing her gamified unlock concept that our perspective shifted, sparking a wave of new ideas. Her approach opened our minds to the potential of a playful, interactive experience, and that’s where the magic began. We quickly aligned on the idea of creating an unlock that would encourage users to think creatively. To truly make it feel like an unlock—and a secure one at that—we decided it should require an unconventional approach, where players would essentially need to "play the game wrong" to succeed. This led to the following sketches:-

        <h2>Refined Sketches</h2>
        After discussion, we found the ball drop idea to be the strongest choice. It was simple—as any good unlock should be—yet creative and visually engaging. We wanted the entire experience, from start to finish, to follow a cohesive theme. This led us to brainstorm not only the core game mechanics but also the design of the lock screen and the transitions throughout.            <p>

        <div class="final-images">
            
            <img src="images/TiltedSkies/r1.JPG" alt="Refined Sketch 1">

            <img src="images/TiltedSkies/r3.JPG" alt="Refined Sketch 2">
        </div>
        <p><br>

Our initial design decisions included creating a calm, blue lock screen to set a soothing tone. We opted to replace the basket with a basketball hoop, adding a playful layer of "fake affordance" to mislead users into aiming for the hoop—only to be locked out upon scoring. We also mapped out a transition from the locked screen to the home screen: when the ball collides with the correct cloud, the screen fills with clouds before gradually fading to reveal the home screen.
            <br>

            <h3> Responding to Feedback</h3>


            When we presented our concept to Professor Terrance Mok, he provided valuable feedback that helped us refine the design. The main takeaways were:
<br>
           <b>1.  Prevent accidental unlocks:</b> What if someone casually swayed the phone and accidentally reached the secret cloud?
          <br> <b> 2. Add another layer of interaction </b>to deepen engagement.
          <br> <br> We brainstormed extensively to address these issues. We considered several options to enhance security and interaction, like limiting the number of phone movements allowed or requiring the user to tap and hover over the cloud for a few seconds. However, we didn’t want to compromise the simplicity of the unlock experience.
            
            <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px; margin-top: 20px;">
                <!-- Image on the left -->
                <img src="images/TiltedSkies/f1.JPG" alt="Improvement Illustration" style="width: 350px; height: auto; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">
        
                <!-- Text on the right -->
                <div>
                    
            Finally, we developed a color-changing system that met all these requirements. Now, when the ball passes through a cloud, its color changes, and only the correct color allows the ball to unlock upon reaching the target cloud. Once the phone is flipped, the ball’s color is “locked,” and it can no longer change colors regardless of additional cloud encounters. We also increased the ball’s speed along the y-axis at this point.
            <br><br>
                    <p>
                        This solution achieved two key improvements:
                    </p>
                    <p><b>1. Enhanced security:</b> The probability of accidentally achieving the correct color and reaching the right cloud is now less than 0.01, significantly reducing the chance of unintended unlocks.</p>
                    <p><b>2. Improved interaction:</b> Now, users must actively pass through clouds to set the correct color before flipping their phone. This extra step makes the process more engaging and satisfying.</p>

        <p> Skyfall was designed to offer an engaging yet secure unlocking experience, blending simplicity with thoughtfully layered interactivity. Our primary focus was to maintain the fluidity of the game while embedding subtle security elements that enhance user involvement without compromising ease of use.

           <br> <br>To give users flexibility, we implemented an array holding various color options, enabling them to decide which clouds to interact with and in which order, based on their comfort and style. This personalized aspect adds depth, allowing each user to engage with the unlock process uniquely. Additionally, even accessing the game requires a triple click on the battery icon, adding a preliminary security layer before gameplay begins.
            
           <br><br> Error handling is another essential component of our design. If a user mistakenly directs the ball to the basketball hoop, an error message appears, alerting them to the mistake and returning them to the lock screen. Similarly, reaching the secret cloud with the wrong color produces the same message, preventing unintended unlocks and reinforcing the need for deliberate actions.
            
           <br><br> Overall, Skyfall represents a seamless blend of creativity, security, and user engagement, offering a memorable unlocking experience that is both intuitive and thoughtfully secure.

I had an amazing time collaborating with this team, constantly bouncing ideas and refining concepts together. My personal contributions focused on advancing the ideation from the initial core mechanics to the more complex color-changing concept that added both depth and security. I was also responsible for implementing the gyroscope sensing, ball movements, scrolling screen, and the visual transitions that create a cohesive experience.

Throughout the project, we worked closely as a team to manage tasks effectively, utilizing version control to keep track of updates and integrate our individual components smoothly. This approach allowed us to collaborate seamlessly, refine each other's ideas, and ensure a polished final product.
