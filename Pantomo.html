        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 20px 0;">
            Pantomo is an innovative interface designed to elevate the experience of playing charades by automating team management, scoring, and timers, while tracking fun player statistics over multiple game sessions seamlessly.
            <br><br>
            <b>Problem:</b> Classic party games like charades often come in card format and require manual setup for teams, scoring, and timekeeping, which can be cumbersome and distract from the fun. Furthermore, tracking such data across multiple teams is more work than anyone would be willing to do.
<br>
            <br>
            While there are numerous online platforms for playing such games, they lack the tangible, interactive quality of physical game nights. The absence of such integrated technology in traditional setups makes it the perfect time to focus on innovations that enhance social gatherings, allowing players to focus solely on enjoying time with friends and family without the hassle of manual calculations and tracking.
<br>
<br>
            <b>Solution: </b> 
            Pantomo bridges the gap between the digital and physical worlds without being intrusive or demanding much from the users. It seamlessly integrates technology with traditional game elementsâ€”letting you still use the prompt cards for that authentic feel. It uses proxemic interactions, such as walking closer to the prompt pile and various gestures, to facilitate round management and timers without having to touch the screen. At the same time, it tracks all team and individual achievements, ensuring a comprehensive and enjoyable gameplay experience!            <br><br>
            As someone who loves hosting game nights, charades has always been an all-time favorite. The desire for competitiveness, paired with the joy of knowing who the ultimate charade champion is, inspired this project. I wanted to create an experience where everyone could get lost in the laughter and energy of the game, without worrying about the technicalities of scorekeeping or team organization. The idea was to blend the simplicity of traditional gameplay with a touch of modern convenience, making game nights more engaging and memorable for everyone involved.

        <h2>Concept Sketches</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 20px 0;">Creating concept sketches while incorporating proxemic interactions was a new challenge for me, as it wasn't something I had ever worked with before. Brainstorming how the physical space between players and the system could be leveraged for seamless interaction was both thought-provoking and exciting. This process allowed me to think beyond the standard user interface, and brought a new world of almost 'magical' interactions. These are some fun ideas that I experimented with :-</p>

                    Pantomo transforms the way charades is played by blending classic gameplay with smart digital enhancements. It offers a unique combination of simplicity and advanced technology to streamline game nights and take the hassle out of managing teams, scores, and timing. Beyond just automating the basics, Pantomo ensures that the social, face-to-face nature of charades is preserved while adding a modern twist that enhances the experience without overshadowing it.                </p>
                
                What truly sets Pantomo apart is its ability to deliver seamless interaction through smart, proxemic-based recognition. The interface adapts intuitively to the playersâ€™ movements and position, enabling an interactive and engaging way to manage rounds, start timers, and award pointsâ€”all without needing to touch the screen.

<br><br>
                    In a perfect world with no budget constraints, this technology would be embedded in the lid of every board game, making gameplay fully automated and effortless. For a practical real-world implementation, Pantomo could exist as a web platform paired with a stationary display device (such as an iPad) positioned next to the game setup. This digital companion would act as the game manager, tracking progress and statistics, enhancing the game night experience, and letting players focus on having fun without the distraction of manual scorekeeping.

                <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
                    <li>I love how the technology runs quietly in the background. You donâ€™t need to keep tapping or inputting dataâ€”just play the game as you normally would, and Pantomo handles everything seamlessly.</li>
                    <li>I like the use of proxemics, my favourite one being the team creation. It feels like a fun photobooth moment with friends, complete with the excitement of fitting into the frame before the countdown ends.</li>
                    <li>I appreciate that Pantomo tracks stats for those who thrive on competition, but itâ€™s designed in a way that doesnâ€™t disrupt the experience for players who just want to enjoy a laid-back game night. </li>

                        <li>Dynamic Game Modes: Introduce new charades challenges or mini-games to keep the experience fresh and engaging for repeat players.</li>
                        <li>Enhanced Proximity Detection: Utilize more advanced sensors to detect subtle player movements and gestures for a more interactive gameplay experience.</li>
                        <li>Player Customization: Allow players to create personalized profiles, complete with avatars and game preferences, adding a personal touch to each session.</li>
