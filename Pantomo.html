        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 20px 0;">
            Pantomo is an innovative interface designed to elevate the experience of playing charades by automating team management, scoring, and timers, while tracking fun player statistics over multiple game sessions seamlessly. The name "Pantomo" is derived from pantomime, a form of theatre that involves miming and slapstick comedy, particularly popular during Christmas. This connection highlights the playful, expressive nature of the game and the lively atmosphere that Pantomo aims to create.            <br><br>
            <b>Problem:</b> Classic party games like charades often come in card format and require manual setup for teams, scoring, and timekeeping, which can be cumbersome and distract from the fun. Furthermore, tracking such data across multiple teams is more work than anyone would be willing to do.
<br>
            <br>
            While there are numerous online platforms for playing such games, they lack the tangible, interactive quality of physical game nights. The absence of such integrated technology in traditional setups makes it the perfect time to focus on innovations that enhance social gatherings, allowing players to focus solely on enjoying time with friends and family without the hassle of manual calculations and tracking.
<br>
<br>
            <b>Solution: </b> 
            Pantomo bridges the gap between the digital and physical worlds without being intrusive or demanding much from the users. It seamlessly integrates technology with traditional game elements—letting you still use the prompt cards for that authentic feel. It uses proxemic interactions, such as walking closer to the prompt pile and various gestures, to facilitate round management and timers without having to touch the screen. At the same time, it tracks all team and individual achievements, ensuring a comprehensive and enjoyable gameplay experience!            <br><br>
            As someone who loves hosting game nights, charades has always been an all-time favorite. The desire for competitiveness, paired with the joy of knowing who the ultimate charade champion is, inspired this project. I wanted to create an experience where everyone could get lost in the laughter and energy of the game, without worrying about the technicalities of scorekeeping or team organization. The idea was to blend the simplicity of traditional gameplay with a touch of modern convenience, making game nights more engaging and memorable for everyone involved.

            Creating concept sketches while incorporating proxemic interactions was a new challenge for me, as it wasn't something I had ever worked with before. Brainstorming how the physical space between players and the system could be leveraged for seamless interaction was both thought-provoking and exciting. This process allowed me to think beyond the standard user interface, and brought a new world of almost 'magical' interactions. These are some fun ideas that I experimented with :-        </p>

    <h2>Storyboard</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 20px 0;">
        As part of this project, leveraging proxemics was a key requirement, which guided my decision-making process. I chose the concept of a game night manager for charades because it inherently involves motion—players naturally move to pick up cue cards, act out prompts, and interact with their team. This built-in movement made charades an ideal candidate for exploring proxemic interactions.
<br><br>
        Not utilizing proxemics for a game like charades felt like a missed opportunity to enhance gameplay by seamlessly integrating natural user movements into the interface. The physical space and motion already present in the game could be cleverly leveraged to automate processes like starting timers, managing turns, and tracking scores without disrupting the flow of the game.
        <br><br>
        With this in mind, I focused on designing interactions that aligned with the organic movements of the players, creating a system that complements the game’s existing dynamics. These are the proxemic interactions I implemented:    </p>

                    Pantomo transforms the way charades is played by blending classic gameplay with smart digital enhancements. It offers a unique combination of simplicity and advanced technology to streamline game nights and take the hassle out of managing teams, scores, and timing. Beyond just automating the basics, Pantomo ensures that the social, face-to-face nature of charades is preserved while adding a modern twist that enhances the experience without overshadowing it.                </p>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Dynamic Player Stats:</strong> Players love to compare stats! Pantomo detects the most recent player to approach and displays their personalized stats, fostering a sense of competition and achievement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Streamlined Team Setup:</strong> With its intuitive "Add New Team" feature, Pantomo uses a camera to detect players in the frame, automatically grouping them into teams. Funny, randomly generated team names add an extra layer of fun and team spirit.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Enhances the Charades Experience:</strong> By automating mundane tasks like timers and scorekeeping, Pantomo allows players to focus on the game and their social interactions, keeping the gameplay immersive and hassle-free.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Future-Ready Design:</strong> Beyond charades, Pantomo’s technology can easily scale to support a variety of turn-based games, including trivia, Pictionary, and more.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    In a perfect world with no budget constraints, this technology would be embedded in the lid of every board game, making gameplay fully automated and effortless. For a practical real-world implementation, Pantomo could exist as a web platform paired with a stationary display device (such as an iPad) positioned next to the game setup. This digital companion would act as the game manager, tracking progress and statistics, enhancing the game night experience, and letting players focus on having fun without the distraction of manual scorekeeping.
