        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 20px 0;">
            DeskSense is a portable, intelligent tabletop attachment designed to transform any workspace into a smarter, more interactive environment. It blends automation with practical usability, offering an accessible and relatively inexpensive solution for enhancing focus, productivity, and engagement.  
      
    <br><br>
  <b>Problem:</b>
                Traditional desks are static and lack the ability to adapt to the dynamic needs of modern learners and professionals. Keeping track of workspace essentials like lighting, managing focus during long study sessions, or tracking tasks on hand can be cumbersome. Moreover, the lack of integrated technology in existing setups makes it harder to stay on track, especially during late nights.
        Buying entirely new, tech-enabled desks can be prohibitively expensive, leaving most people stuck with their current static setups, unable to access the potential benefits of smarter workspace tools.
      
    <br><br>
       <b>Solution:</b>
            DeskSense offers an innovative solution by providing a portable tabletop attachment that can be added to any existing desk. It automates workspace essentials such as lighting, task and timer management through intuitive sensing technology while addressing focus loss with a built-in wake-up system. Using ultrasonic sensors, photoresistors, and motorized attachments, DeskSense responds to your movements and presence, creating an efficient study or work experience.
     
             With easy installation and an emphasis on portability, DeskSense ensures that upgrading your workspace is both affordable and hassle-free.
        </p>
    

        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 20px 0;"> As someone who values productivity and focus, the idea for DeskSense was born out of a desire to create a workspace that evolves with the user. Personally, getting myself to sit at the desk isn’t too difficult, but actually getting started is where I often stumble. I find myself procrastinating on my phone or getting caught up in other distractions. This frustration inspired the automatic features of DeskSense—like the light turning on and the book opening as soon as I take my place. These small, thoughtful actions serve as a gentle nudge, inviting me to dive into my tasks right away, without giving procrastination a chance to take hold.

        <h2>Concept Sketches</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 20px 0;">
            To kick off the ideation process, I began by discussing with my team and introspecting to identify everyday problems—whether big or small—that we encounter in our routines. "Everything" can be an everyday problem for someone, but we aimed to bring forward an idea that the majority of people around us could relate to and benefit from.
        <br><br>
        From this foundation, we brainstormed potential solutions for the problems we identified, making a conscious effort not to limit ourselves creatively. We encouraged open-mindedness and imagination to ensure our ideas were innovative and impactful.

These are the concepts we came up with during our exploration of everyday challenges and potential solutions.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Proximity Detection:</strong> Using an ultrasonic sensor, DeskSense detects when you approach or leave the desk, automatically turning on the light and opening a book as you sit, and reversing the actions when you step away.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Smart Wake-Up Mechanism:</strong> If the photoresistor detects diminished light (indicating you’ve dozed off with your head on the desk), DeskSense springs into action. A motorized attachment gently nudges you awake, accompanied by an alarm to refocus your attention.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Hands-Free Automation:</strong> DeskSense employs gesture-based control, eliminating the need for manual interaction, so you can remain fully immersed in your tasks without distractions.

                <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
                    <li>I love how the technology runs quietly in the background. You don’t need to keep tapping or inputting data—just play the game as you normally would, and Pantomo handles everything seamlessly.</li>
                    <li>I like the use of proxemics, my favourite one being the team creation. It feels like a fun photobooth moment with friends, complete with the excitement of fitting into the frame before the countdown ends.</li>
                    <li>I appreciate that Pantomo tracks stats for those who thrive on competition, but it’s designed in a way that doesn’t disrupt the experience for players who just want to enjoy a laid-back game night. </li>
