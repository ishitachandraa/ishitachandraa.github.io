        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 20px 0;">
            DeskSense is a portable, intelligent tabletop attachment designed to transform any workspace into a smarter, more interactive environment. It blends automation with practical usability, offering an accessible and relatively inexpensive solution for enhancing focus, productivity, and engagement.  
      
    <br><br>
  <b>Problem:</b>
                Traditional desks are static and lack the ability to adapt to the dynamic needs of modern learners and professionals. Keeping track of workspace essentials like lighting, managing focus during long study sessions, or tracking tasks on hand can be cumbersome. Moreover, the lack of integrated technology in existing setups makes it harder to stay on track, especially during late nights.
        Buying entirely new, tech-enabled desks can be prohibitively expensive, leaving most people stuck with their current static setups, unable to access the potential benefits of smarter workspace tools.
      
    <br><br>
       <b>Solution:</b>
            DeskSense offers an innovative solution by providing a portable tabletop attachment that can be added to any existing desk. It automates workspace essentials such as lighting, task and timer management through intuitive sensing technology while addressing focus loss with a built-in wake-up system. Using ultrasonic sensors, photoresistors, and motorized attachments, DeskSense responds to your movements and presence, creating an efficient study or work experience.
     
             With easy installation and an emphasis on portability, DeskSense ensures that upgrading your workspace is both affordable and hassle-free.
        </p>
    

        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 20px 0;"> As someone who values productivity and focus, the idea for DeskSense was born out of a desire to create a workspace that evolves with the user. Personally, getting myself to sit at the desk isn’t too difficult, but actually getting started is where I often stumble. I find myself procrastinating on my phone or getting caught up in other distractions. This frustration inspired the automatic features of DeskSense—like the light turning on and the book opening as soon as I take my place. These small, thoughtful actions serve as a gentle nudge, inviting me to dive into my tasks right away, without giving procrastination a chance to take hold.

        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 20px 0;">
            To kick off the ideation process, I began by discussing with my team and introspecting to identify everyday problems—whether big or small—that we encounter in our routines. "Everything" can be an everyday problem for someone, but we aimed to bring forward an idea that the majority of people around us could relate to and benefit from.
        <br><br>
        Building on this foundation, we brainstormed potential solutions to the identified problems, consciously avoiding creative limitations. We encouraged open-mindedness and imagination to ensure our ideas were innovative and impactful.

These are the concepts we came up with during our exploration of everyday challenges and potential solutions.

    <h2>Storyboard</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 20px 0;">
        We decided to move forward with the study desk idea since we would like to use something like this in our own lives. We planned out all component positions and ensured that we'll be able to hide all wires and connections, keeping the table neat and tidy. We also decided to add a mobile interface to integrate studying techniques like Pomodoro and have all goals in one place.<br>

<br><br>
        To better illustrate the functionality and user experience of DeskSense, we created storyboard sketches that depict its use in real-life scenarios. These sketches highlight how DeskSense integrates seamlessly into a workspace, showcasing its automatic features—like lighting, book opening, and wake-up prompts—and its ability to gently guide users into productive sessions

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Proximity Detection:</strong> Using an ultrasonic sensor, DeskSense detects when you approach or leave the desk, automatically turning on the light and opening a book as you sit, and reversing the actions when you step away.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Smart Wake-Up Mechanism:</strong> If the photoresistor detects diminished light (indicating you’ve dozed off with your head on the desk), DeskSense springs into action. A motorized attachment gently nudges you awake, accompanied by an alarm to refocus your attention.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Hands-Free Automation:</strong> DeskSense employs gesture-based control, eliminating the need for manual interaction, so you can remain fully immersed in your tasks without distractions.
                        </li>

                    <b>Portable and Accessible:</b>
                   
                        DeskSense is designed to be a portable tabletop that can be easily installed onto any existing desk. This makes it an accessible and relatively inexpensive solution for upgrading your workspace. Whether you’re using it at home, in an office, or in a study room, DeskSense provides a hassle-free way to enhance productivity and convenience without the need for a brand-new desk.

                <h3>Challenged We Faced</h3>
                
                <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
                    <li>It was difficult to find the optimal threshold for distance sensing, as the book cover on the table and the desk chair frequently triggered the sensor.<br>
                        Solution: We elevated the sensor using the base of a candle holder to improve its positioning. Additionally, we set a range for the threshold instead of relying on a single value and conducted multiple tests to ensure smooth and reliable interactions.</li>
                    <li>The 'smacking' stick, which was initially glued to the motor, repeatedly fell off after colliding with the user.<br>
                        Solution: We designed and 3D-printed a custom connector to securely attach the stick to the motor, ensuring it remained firmly in position during use.</li>
                </ul>

                    <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
                        <li>This desk concept has the potential to be adapted for a variety of other scenarios beyond book reading and studying. Developing a generalized version or creating multiple specialized versions tailored to different needs would open up exciting and practical possibilities for broader applications.</li>
                        <li>The interface could be designed to recognize different users and automatically adjust settings such as study timers, light color, intensity, and other preferences based on their saved profiles.</li>
                        <li>
                            The features could be expanded to include ambient sound options for enhanced focus, posture detection to promote ergonomic habits, and a rewarding candy dispensing system triggered when a task is marked as complete.</li>
