        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 20px 0;">"Asim's Subconscious Decisions" is an interactive narrative experience that invites users to explore the pivotal moments in Asim's life that ultimately guided him toward a career in computer science. Asim is a character caught in the tension between his own passions and the expectations of his parents, who are both successful lawyers. This internal conflict serves as the backdrop for four critical choices he faces, each reflecting his struggle to navigate between a predetermined path and his authentic interests.<br><br>

            Through scenarios like selecting extracurricular courses, choosing between friends and personal projects, and weighing the excitement of a summer job against a resume-boosting opportunity, users are given the chance to step into Asim's shoes and make decisions that align with their values. The project emphasizes the importance of staying true to oneself, whether that leads to a conventional route or a more unconventional one.<br><br>
            
            By allowing users to diverge from Asim's path, the project not only highlights his personal journey but also encourages reflection on the broader themes of identity, ambition, and the courage to pursue one's passions despite external pressures. Ultimately, "Asim's Subconscious Decisions" is a testament to the power of choice and the diverse outcomes that arise from the crossroads we all face in life.

            In the design process, we aimed to explore various possibilities to effectively convey Asim's journey and the choices he faced. This involved experimenting with different visual representations and interactive elements to enhance user engagement. Here are the key aspects I explored while sketching:<br><br>
            
             <b>* Life Path Visualization:</b> Considered various representations of the life path, including a tree structure, timeline, progress bar and conversation with subconscious, each illustrating Asim's journey and crucial decision points.<br>
        
             <b>* Choice Representation: </b> Investigated different methods to display choices, such as side-split screen, choice visuals and text based replies, allowing users to deliberate their options effectively.<br>
            
             <b>* Button Design: </b> Experimented with various button designs, transitioning from half screen buttons to smaller icons, to even incorporating "next" and "confirm" functionalities to enhance user interaction.<br>

After discussing our initial sketches, we decided to visualize our buttons as puzzle pieces that users ultimately add to a 'puzzle frame' of life. This symbolizes how each decision fits into their journey, whether typical or unconventional, reinforcing the idea that no choice is wrong or bad. At every prompt given by the narrator, users can choose from different pieces, with each piece representing a different choice. We also opted for a dark and calm background to reflect characteristics from Asim's personality.

        <br>
        <p> For our final product, we designed an interactive experience where users are guided through four pivotal prompts, with each decision represented by a puzzle piece that fills out a life puzzle frame. Initially, we planned for the buttons to be shaped like puzzle pieces to signify how each choice fits into Asim's journey, whether conventional or unconventional, emphasizing that no decision is inherently wrong. However, implementing complex puzzle-shaped buttons turned out to be challenging, so we opted for simpler square-like pieces to maintain clarity and functionality.

           <br> The design features a dark blue background that evokes calm and introspection, in line with Asim's personality. The imagery starts with serene landscapes like lakes and mountains, gradually transitioning into space and stars, symbolizing Asim's journey from grounded decisions to limitless possibilities. The lake represents his introspective moments, while the starry sky symbolizes the boundless potential he discovers as he follows his passions. Throughout the experience, a narrator, representing Asim's subconscious, guides users through each critical life choice.</p>
